# MATH OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING MATH OPERATIONS ARE SUPPORTED:

* ADDITION: `+`
* SUBTRACTION: `-`
* MULTIPLICATION: `*`
* DIVISION: `/`
* REMAINDER: `%`
* EXPONENTIATION: `**`

## BASIC OPERATIONS

THE FIRST FOUR OPERATIONSS ARE STRAIGHTFORWARD:

```javascript
console.log(6+2); // SHOWS 8
console.log(6-2); // SHOWS 4
console.log(6*2); // SHOWS 12
console.log(6/2); // SHOWS 3
```

WHILE `%` AND `**` NEED A FEW WORDS ABOUT THEM...

## REMAINDER

THE REMAINDER OPERATOR `%`, DESPITE ITS APPEARANCE, IS NOT RELATED TO PERCENTS.THE RESULT OF `a % b` IS THE REMAINDER OF THE INTEGER DIVISION OF `a` BY `b`. FOR INSTANCE:

```javascript
console.log( 5 % 2 ); // SHOWS 1 (A REMAINDER OF 5 DIVIDED BY 2)
console.log( 8 % 3 ); // SHOWS 2 (A REMAINDER OF 8 DIVIDED BY 3)
```

## EXPONENTIATION **

THE EXPONENTIATION OPERATOR `a ** b` RAISES `a` TO THE POWER OF `b`. IN SCHOOL MATHS, WE WRITE THAT AS $a^b$. FOR INSTANCE:

```javascript
console.log(2 ** 2); // 2² = 4
console.log(2 ** 3); // 2³ = 8
console.log(2 ** 4); // 2⁴ = 16
```
