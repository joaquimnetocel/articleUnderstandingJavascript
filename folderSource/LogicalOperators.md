# LOGICAL OPERATORS (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

THERE ARE FOUR LOGICAL OPERATORS IN JAVASCRIPT:

* `||` (OR)
* `&&` (AND)
* `!` (NOT)
* `??` (NULLISH COALESCING).

HERE WE COVER THE FIRST THREE, THE ?? OPERATOR IS IN THE NEXT ARTICLE.

ALTHOUGH THEY ARE CALLED "LOGICAL", THEY CAN BE APPLIED TO VALUES OF ANY TYPE, NOT ONLY BOOLEAN. THEIR RESULT CAN ALSO BE OF ANY TYPE.

LET’S SEE THE DETAILS.

## OR

THE "OR" OPERATOR IS REPRESENTED WITH TWO VERTICAL LINE SYMBOLS `||`. THERE ARE FOUR POSSIBLE LOGICAL COMBINATIONS:

```javascript
console.log(true || true); // SHOWS true
console.log(false || true); // SHOWS true
console.log(true || false); // SHOWS true
console.log(false || false); // SHOWS false
```

IN ADDITION TO THESE 4 TRIVIAL CASES, IF AN OPERAND IS NOT A BOOLEAN, IT’S CONVERTED TO A BOOLEAN FOR THE EVALUATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE NUMBER `1` IS TREATED AS `true` AND THE NUMBER `0` AS `false`:

```javascript
console.log(1 || 0); // WORKS JUST LIKE true || false AND RETURNS 1
```
